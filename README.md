# Homework 1
This is our first homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with cleaning up the code without editing the original web page. I fixed any broken code and cleaned it up by removing unnecessary tags and classes, among other things. as many accessability options were added as possible. More responsive code was added for different devices as well.
