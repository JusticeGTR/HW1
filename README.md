# Homework 1
This is our first homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with refactoring the existing code. 

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I fixed any broken code and cleaned it up by removing unnecessary tags and classes, among other things. as many accessability options were added as possible. More responsive code was added for different devices as well.
